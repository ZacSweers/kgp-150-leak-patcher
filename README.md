# kgp-150-leak-patcher

A simple plugin to automatically patch the memory leak in Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.5.0 in 
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-46368.

Implementation based on [David Burstr√∂m](https://github.com/davidburstrom)'s workaround [here](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-46368#focus=Comments-27-4868598.0-0).

## Usage

Apply the plugin in the root `build.gradle` file, no other configuration needed. It will no-op if 
the detected runtime version of KGP is not `1.5.0`.

```kotlin
// Apply in the root build.gradle file
plugins {
 id("dev.zacsweers.kgp-150-leak-patcher") version "1.0.0"
}

// Or legacy way
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath("dev.zacsweers:kgp-150-leak-patcher:1.0.0")
  }
}

apply(plugin = "dev.zacsweers.kgp-150-leak-patcher")
```
